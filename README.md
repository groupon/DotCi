###Features
***
 * **Github Integration** (both github.com and GHE)
    - Automatically sets up Github webhooks for pull requests and github pushes when a new job is setup.
    - Sets [commit status](https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api) during and after build run.
      ![Commit status](docs/screenshots/commit-status.png)

    - Projects are name-spaced under organization which allows creation of multiple projects with same names under different organizations.


 * **Build configuration through .ci.yml**  
    * Speed up builds by running builds in parallel.

    * Branch/pusher specific build customization through groovy templating.
    * Plugin configuration.
    * Notification configuration.
    * Skip Builds based on sha/branch/pusher/pull request etc.


 * **Docker Support**
    * Having a Dockerfile in the repo will build an image and run tests against the image.

 * **Defaults** for each language type (eg: ``mvn install`` for java), language is auto detected.

 * **Scaling Jenkins**.
   * Backed by a mongodb database
   * No need to purge builds to improve startup time/performance.
   * Query build statistics by querying database.
 * **Build shortcuts for deploy/command line tools**

   * Or branch specific permalinks (`lastSuccessfulMaster`) .

 * **Extensible**
   * Add new types of notifications/plugins supported in .ci.yml by writing plugins for DotCi.
